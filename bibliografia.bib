  abstract  = {Conventional methods of system load shedding are too slow and do not effectively calculate the correct amount of load to be shed. This results in either excessive or insufficient load reduction. In recent years, load shedding systems have been repackaged using conventional under-frequency relay and/or breaker interlocks schemes integrated with programmable logic controllers to give a new look to an antiquated load preservation methodology. A truly modern and intelligent load shedding system with a computerized power management system should provide fast and optimal load management by utilizing system topology and actual operating conditions tempered with knowledge of past system disturbances. This paper demonstrates the need for a modern load shedding scheme and introduces the new technology of intelligent load shedding. Comparisons of intelligent load shedding with conventional load shedding methods are made from perspectives of system design, system engineering, project implementation, and system operation. A case study of the application of an intelligent load shedding scheme in a large industrial facility is provided.},

These include intelligent load shedding (ILS), distributed ILS (DILS), Everett optimization, analytic hierarchical process (AHP), and network flow programming (NFP). Load shedding by frequency relays is the most commonly used method for controlling the frequency of power networks within set limits and maintaining network stability under critical conditions. Blackouts are becoming more frequent in industrial countries because of network deficiencies and continuous load growing. Transmission congestion occurs when there is insufficient transmission capacity to meet the demands of all customers. The chapter discusses several approaches for optimal load shedding, which can be used for congestion management. It presents simple-load shedding or load-management methods for congestion management.},
